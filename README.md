# Polynomial-Regression-Model-For-M_Paper
This repository contains the polynomial regression models developed for our flow problem study. The dataset, calculated from all combinations of input flow parameters, is provided to implement and test polynomial regression. The code allows prediction of output variables for arbitrary combinations of input parameters.
